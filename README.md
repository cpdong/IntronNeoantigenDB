## Description
Here, we present IntronNeoantigenDB(intron retain derived neoantigen) to query the impact of intron retain for neoantigen affinity. IntronNeoantigenDB is establised based on gencode GRCh38 gtf annotation file.The intron sets were re-processed to avoid inducing any existed exon sequence inside. This site provides the pre-computed MHC-I binding scores for hg38 and software toolkit to obtain the scores for queried intron regions.
